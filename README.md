# LIQUID MOTION SIMULATION
## Interactive Physics-Based Droplet Animation

Created by: Abbas Davarpanah

DESCRIPTION:
This interactive simulation creates realistic liquid droplets that follow your mouse movements with physics-based behavior. The droplets respond to gravity, friction, and bounce realistically off screen edges. Features include:

- Dual theme support (light/dark mode)
- Dynamic droplet creation based on mouse speed
- Physics parameters customizable in code
- Splash effects when droplets hit bottom
- Natural wobble animation for liquid appearance
- Performance optimized with maximum droplet limit

TECHNOLOGY:
- Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no libraries)
- RequestAnimationFrame for smooth animation
- Physics calculations for realistic motion
- CSS transitions for visual effects

USAGE:
Simply move your mouse around the screen to create droplets. The faster you move, the more droplets are generated. Click the theme toggle button to switch between light and dark modes.
